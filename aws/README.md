# AWS helper scripts
The files contained herein are various scripts I've used and re-used over the years to help with managing AWS resources.  Hopefully, there will come a day when they are no longer needed, but until then, they're here.

For those who would object: yes, I used perl for them.  I liked perl a lot at the time, and it was pretty widely available.  Still is, really.  Future entries may be done in straight bash with basic linux tools, should I get inspired.
